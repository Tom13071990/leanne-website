    <p>
      Myofunctional therapy addresses the underlying muscle patterns of the face,
      tongue, and mouth that can contribute to a wide range of functional difficulties.
      These conditions may appear in childhood or adulthood and often affect daily life,
      development, and overall well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are some of the most common conditions that benefit from
      <strong>myofunctional therapy</strong>.

        <strong>Tongue Thrust:</strong>
        Improper tongue placement during swallowing or at rest,

        <strong>Sleep-Disordered Breathing & Snoring:</strong>
        Oral muscle dysfunction may contribute to airway collapse,
        snoring, and poor-quality sleep.

        Inefficient chewing, gagging, or picky eating related to oral

<!-- WHY THERAPY HELPS -->
<section class="purple-section">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>
      Why Myofunctional Therapy Helps
    </h2>

    <p>
      Many of these conditions share a common root:
      inefficient muscle function and incorrect oral posture.
      Myofunctional therapy focuses on retraining these muscles,
      promoting nasal breathing, proper tongue placement,
      and functional swallowing patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therapy is individualized and often works alongside
      orthodontists, dentists, ENTs, and other healthcare professionals.
