    <h2>
      Who Is craniofacial Therapy For?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Myofunctional therapy is appropriate for
      <strong>children, adolescents, and adults</strong>.
     This therapy is especially beneficial for children who experience
      mouth breathing, feeding challenges, unclear speech, jaw tension,
      or facial muscle weakness. Through gentle, targeted exercises and
      guided techniques, craniofacial therapy supports proper muscle
      function and promotes long-term stability.

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
<section class="purple-section">
  <div class="container">

    <h2>
      What Does the Therapy Process Look Like?
    </h2>

       <p>
      During therapy, gentle hands-on techniques and targeted exercises are
      used to release tension, improve mobility, and support proper muscle
      activation. This helps the nervous system recognize healthier movement
      patterns and positioning.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Kinesiotaping</strong> is often used as a supportive tool within
      craniofacial therapy. When applied to specific facial or cervical areas,
      the tape provides gentle sensory input that helps guide muscle function,
      improve awareness, and support symmetry—without restricting movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tape remains in place for several days, allowing the body to receive
      continuous feedback between sessions. This ongoing input reinforces the
      work done in therapy and helps maintain progress during daily activities
      such as breathing, eating, speaking, and resting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Craniofacial therapy combined with kinesiotaping supports long-term
      changes by addressing both the structure and function of the muscles,
      helping children and adults develop healthier, more efficient movement
      patterns over time.
    </p>
